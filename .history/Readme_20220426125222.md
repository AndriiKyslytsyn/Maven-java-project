# Simple test on Step MongoDB using Selenium framework


## Install environment

-  Follow our documentation to install the Open-Source version of our step application on-premise on your laptop (https://step.exense.ch/knowledgebase/3.18/getting-started/quick-setup/) and start it. You do not need a step agent for this exercise
-  Install Chrome and the appropriate version of ChromeDriver on your laptop (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
-   Start a new Maven Java project with the Selenium test framework as a dependency (https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)
- 
-   Write a simple JUnit test that will perform a login to your local step instance using the Selenium framework (the browser must be Chrome or Chromium)
-   Extend the test to browse the step tabs (Plans, Keywords, Parameters, etc.) and make sure that the tab is loaded (lookup for an element on the page) before moving to the next one
